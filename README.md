# torch
Torch code to train short answer models with 300 dimensional word-embeddings plus the f-measure of the overlaps (harmonic mean of the precision and recall of the overlaps) between student answer and the sample reference text as features. (The code used to compute the f-measure feature is present under torch-features.)
